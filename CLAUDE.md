# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Documentation Lookup

Always use the Context7 MCP plugin (`mcp__plugin_context7_context7`) to fetch up-to-date docs and code examples when working with library/API documentation, code generation, setup, or configuration steps — without the user having to explicitly ask. Always prefer Context7 over relying on training data for API references, configuration options, or usage patterns.
